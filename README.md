## ðŸŽ¯ Features  
- Support for **multiple investments** (each with its own amount, annual interest rate, and compounding frequency: annually, quarterly, monthly).  
- Calculates growth using the formula:  
  \[
    \text{Future Value} = P \times \Bigl(1 + \frac{r}{m}\Bigr)^{\,m \times n}
  \]  
  where:  
    - \(P\) = principal amount  
    - \(r\) = annual interest rate (decimal)  
    - \(m\) = compounding frequency per year  
    - \(n\) = number of years  
- Adjusts results for **inflation** (real return calculation).  
- Displays results in a **table** (year-by-year breakdown for each investment + total inflation-adjusted).  
- Displays results in a **chart** using Chart.js, showing each investment trajectory and the total real value.  
- **Nicer input validation UI**: error highlighting, helpful tooltips on inputs.  
- **Responsive design**: built with Tailwind CSS to work well on mobile, tablet & desktop. Tables scroll horizontally on smaller screens.  
- Persists inputs and settings (currency symbol, investments list) in **localStorage** so the userâ€™s data isnâ€™t lost on reload.  
- Ability to choose **currency symbol** (â‚¹, $, â‚¬, etc.) to format displayed values.  
- Built with a frontend-only stack (no backend), so you can deploy easily to platforms like Vercel or Netlify.
